        <div class="">
          <h3>b) General Conditions</h3>
          <p>
            1.1 Gosnami´s website and mobile application is an online platform where Clients state their
            requests and interest in the provision of a particular service, and where professionals providing
            various services register to access the presented requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.2 Each request must represent a real need of the Client. Gosnami may, at its sole discretion,
            exclude all requests and/or content published on the platform that do not comply with the terms
            and conditions or content that may harm the Gosnami brand or the image of professionals and
            clients using the services.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.3 The requests submitted by Clients are disclosed to registered Professionals whose activity is
            compatible with them, so they can, if they wish, present proposals and budgets directly to
            Clients for the requested services.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.4 It is the Client's responsibility to evaluate the budget proposals and services presented by
            Professionals, and the selection of the Professional is entirely and exclusively the responsibility
            of the Client.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.5 Gosnami’s role is limited to collecting Client’s requests and registrations of service provider
            Professionals, disclosing the requests to them to enable the Client's selection process. Whenever
            Gosnami presents or refers a Professional to a Client, it is solely and ultimately the Client's
            decision to accept the budget proposal and services presented, including those received through
            Gosnami. There is no employment or subordination relationship between the Professional and
            Gosnami.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.6 The Client may choose not to select any of the Professionals who contact them to present
            their respective budgets, recognizing that Gosnami is a third party in the contractual relationship
            established between the Client and the Professional. Gosnami cannot guarantee the fulfillment
            of the service by the Professional or any transaction agreed upon between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.7 The information regarding requests and Professionals on the website is provided by Clients
            and Professionals, respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.8 Despite the above, Gosnami does not select specific Professionals; the acquisition of the
            budget request occurs whenever Professionals decide to use their credits for that purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.9 Clients have the right to evaluate, signing or anonymously, the contact made and/or service
            provided by any Professional registered on Gosnami who chooses to contact them through the
            platform. Clients can leave a "Review" on Gosnami, and Professionals have the right to respond
            with a "Comment." Reviews and Comments reflect the opinions of users (Clients and
            Professionals, respectively) and not the opinion of Gosnami. Reviews and Comments are not
            verified or filtered by Gosnami, and it is not responsible for ensuring their accuracy; they may
            be incorrect or misleading.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.10 Reviews and Comments made by Clients and Professionals must be fair, true, and factual,
            and cannot contain defamatory or offensive language.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.11 Users (Clients and Professionals) are prohibited from manipulating the Review and
            Comment system, such as giving instructions to a third party to write a positive or negative
            Comment about another Member.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.12 Clients and Professionals undertake to include on the website only true and correct
            information and, whenever necessary for the service to be provided, documentary evidence for
            the exercise of their respective activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.13 Gosnami is not responsible for the information mentioned above, and the Client must,
            before selecting the Professional, assess and verify its truthfulness, correctness, and integrity.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.14 The presentation by the Professional to the Client of fraudulent proposals or false or
            incorrect documents can never be attributed to Gosnami, and the Client is responsible for
            selecting Professionals and confirming the information provided by them.

          <h2>5. Responsibility</h2>
          <p>
            5.1 Gosnami is not a party, in any capacity, to the contractually established relationship between
            the Client and the Professional. Therefore, the Client and the Professional acknowledge that no
            responsibility can be attributed to Gosnami, particularly regarding the fulfillment of the contract
            and the compliance with contractual duties by the parties, or even for the presentation of a
            Professional to the Client or the submission of a quote to the Client on behalf of the
            Professional.
          </p>
          <p>
            5.2 Similarly, no responsibility can be attributed to Gosnami for the contractual non-compliance
            of either party or for any non-contractual liability. Moreover, no responsibility can be imputed
            for any losses or damages that may result for either party.

          <p>
            5.3 Gosnami does not make any statement or provide any guarantee regarding the reliability,

            bears the full risk arising from the hiring of a Professional, in accordance with the maximum

          <p>
            7.2 The use of the website and mobile application may be suspended for a certain period

            is demonstrated. In such cases, the possibility of using the credits of the involved Professionals
            is also suspended during the same period. The use of available credits is suspended until there is
            confirmation that the issue is resolved by both parties – professional and client. In case of
            non-resolution of the problem, the available credits will remain suspended.

          <p>
            7.3 Clients and Professionals may be permanently prevented from using the website whenever a
