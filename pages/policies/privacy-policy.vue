          <p>
            “Personal data” is any information that can identify you either
            directly (for example, your name) or indirectly (for example, data presented

          <p>
            Gosnami may collect your data under a legal or regulatory imperative,
            a contractual relationship, its legitimate interest (in order to improve its
            products and services), and/or informed consent.

            We may share your personal data to comply with legal or contractual
            obligations, to improve our products and services, or after obtaining your
            consent.

            Depending on the purpose for which they are collected, and
            exclusively on a need-to-know basis, Gosnami may have access to some of
            your personal data; whenever possible, the data is presented under a
            pseudonym (not allowing direct identification), and whenever necessary to
            provide you with the requested services.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are external entities that assist Gosnami in providing IT
            services, such as WEB hosting and maintenance services, as well as

            measures to guarantee the security of your information to protect your
            personal data.

            We only store your personal data for as long as necessary to achieve
            the purpose associated with processing it. To determine the data retention period, we use the following
            criteria:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>∙ When you register on the Gosnami Platform, we will store your data
              for as long as you are our customer.
            </li>
            <li>∙ When you submit an application to work at Gosnami, the data you
              provide will be kept for a period of two years.
            </li>
            <li>
              ∙ When cookies are placed on your computer, Gosnami will keep them
              for as long as necessary to achieve its objectives (for example, session
              identification cookies) defined in the cookies chapter;
            </li>
            <li>
              ∙ When you send the documents required for verification and validation
              of accounts, we will keep them long enough to fulfill your objective.
              After that, they will be completely deleted from all of our systems.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Gosnami may retain some of your personal data to comply with its
            legal or regulatory obligations, as well as to administer your rights (for
            example, to enforce petitions in Court) or for statistical or historical
            purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the use of your personal data is no longer necessary, it will be
            removed from the Gosnami system or kept anonymous so that you cannot be
            identified from the data.

          <p>
            Gosnami is committed to keeping your personal data secure and takes
            all appropriate precautions to do so. As such, it is contractually required
            that trusted external entities that process your personal data on our behalf do
            the same.
